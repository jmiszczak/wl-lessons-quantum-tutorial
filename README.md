# wl-lessons-quantum-tutorial

In this tutorial we introduce the basic block of used in quantum computing using only the basic data structures available in Wolfram language.  We demonstrate how the concept from quantum computing can be mapped on the elements of Wolfram language, such as lists and functions.

The tutorial is based on the examples from the book: Jaros≈Çaw A. Miszczak, Short Lessons on Wolfram Language: Programming, Data Processing, Graphics, Machine Learning, and Quantum Computing with Mathematica, ISBN: 978-83-66950-01-6, Quoqa Pubs, 2024.
